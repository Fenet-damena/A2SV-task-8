# Job Listing Application

This is a modern, responsive **Job Listing Dashboard** built with **Next.js**, **React**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **TypeScript**. The goal is to replicate a detailed job listing and description interface based on a Figma UI design. It features dynamic job data fetched directly from a remote API, clean navigation, and design precision.

---

## What We Implemented

* **Job Cards UI:** Reusable `JobCard` components styled to match the design exactly.  
* **Job Detail Page:** Built with proper layout, icons, fonts, and spacing following the reference.  
* **Ideal Candidate Block:** Correct layout and styling for candidate traits, age, and gender.  
* **Mobile Responsive:** Fully responsive layout optimised for different screen sizes.  
* **API Data Integration:** Job listings and details are dynamically fetched from the remote API endpoint (`https://akil-backend.onrender.com/opportunities/search`) using the native JavaScript `fetch` API.  
* **Dynamic Routing:** Implemented dynamic routes for detailed job pages based on job IDs fetched via `fetch`.
