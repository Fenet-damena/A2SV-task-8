# Job Listing Application

This is a modern, responsive **Job Listing Dashboard** built with **Next.js**, **React**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **TypeScript**. The goal is to replicate a detailed job listing and description interface based on a Figma UI design. It features dynamic job data, clean navigation, and design precision.

---

##  What We Implemented

*  **Job Cards UI:** Reusable `JobCard` components styled to match the design exactly.
*  **Job Detail Page:** Built with proper layout, icons, fonts, and spacing following the reference.
*  **Icon Styling:** All icons are consistently styled using blue as specified in the design.
*  **Back Navigation:** A visible back button allows users to return from the job detail page.
*  **Section Dividers:** Clean horizontal separators between “About”, “Categories”, and “Required Skills”.
*  **Ideal Candidate Block:** Correct layout and styling for candidate traits, age, and gender.
*  **Mobile Responsive:** Fully responsive layout optimised for different screen sizes.
*  **Radix UI Dropdowns:** Integrated dropdown filter using Radix UI for category/tag filtering.
*  **Static JSON Data:** Populated job listings using local JSON for simulation.
